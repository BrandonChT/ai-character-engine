## 🎬 Quick Demo

> **See it in action!** Watch your NPCs come alive with real personalities:

```python
from character_engine import Character, Conversation

# Create characters that feel real
knight = Character(
    name="Sir Galadon",
    personality={"bravery": 9, "loyalty": 8, "wisdom": 6},
    goals=["Protect the kingdom", "Find the lost artifact"],
    speaking_style="formal, honorable, slightly poetic"
)

merchant = Character(
    name="Baron Von Trader", 
    personality={"friendliness": 7, "greed": 8, "cunning": 6},
    goals=["Make profit", "Expand business", "Stay safe"],
    speaking_style="charming, persuasive, money-focused"
)

# Watch them interact naturally
characters = {"knight": knight, "merchant": merchant}
conversation = Conversation(characters, "Medieval marketplace")

responses = conversation.run_round("The knight approaches the merchant's stall")
for name, response in responses.items():
    print(f"{name}: {response}")
```

**Output:**
```
knight: "Good morrow, merchant. Your wares are most exquisite this day."
merchant: "Ah, noble knight! For you, a special price on this fine blade..."
```
